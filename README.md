# ROTMG_Patience
A simulator for the Patience phase of ROTMG's Forgotten King fight

I recreated a simulator for the Patience phase of ROTMG's Forgotten King fight using pygame. I used the sprites in u/Mxple's version (https://github.com/Mxple/TPGsim). I've been using their's for a
while since they did a really good job with it. I just wanted to make my own in pygame to eventually train an AI to play it. It's my first time coding a game ever, so I hope ya'll enjoy it.

Added as much detail as I could to make it resemble the real game. The application along with the data file is in a zip file in the releases named Patience.zip. I have yet to add screen rotations and such, but I might add stuff like other player skins too later on.
